### General Info
***
In this package you will find:

* a file "arm.urdf.xacro" which defines our RR robot and the onboard camera.
* A "target.urdf" file to describe the target model. 

The camera is placed at the end of the end effector and only tracks targets in the XY plane. The simulation is launched on Rviz. For a simulation on Gazebo, see the launch files in the integ_gazebo folder.
